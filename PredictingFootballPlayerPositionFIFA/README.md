# PredictingFootballPlayerPositionFIFA

I will be using machine learning algorithms on a classification problem for predicting a football playerâ€™s position based on their data statistics. This will classify if a player is either a Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, or a Forward type of player. The inputs are a dataset containing attribute ratings for each player and the outputs is going to be a model that aims to have an improved prediction accuracy.
